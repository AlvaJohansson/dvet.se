# Mega6
What is student life without
parties? There are many reasons
to celebrate: to relax, socialize,
have fun, or simply let loose. Regardless of your reason, we know
that your (like everyone else’s)
student life wouldn’t be the same
without a proper party now and
then.

We, Mega6, are the party committee of DVD, and we are passionate about enhancing your
student life with parties of all
kinds. Our main type of event is
called “sittningar,” where people gather around a table, enjoy
food, drinks, and sing-alongs - all
following tradition. Of course,
drinks are always optional. ;)

Mega6 also organizes smaller
gatherings (such as “krök” in
Monaden) with a more relaxed
atmosphere.

We are already looking forward
to meeting you, dearest Recentior, and remember, there are no
re-parties, only re-exams.
