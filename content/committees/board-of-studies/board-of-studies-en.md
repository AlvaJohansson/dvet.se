# Board of Studies
We at the Computer Science education committee (studienämnden) are here to ensure the quali-
ty of education and studies in
the bachelor program. We work
to represent students’ opinions by actively participating in
course evaluation meetings for
the mandatory courses.

We also encourage you to take
part in the course evaluation
surveys that are sent out at the
end of each course. Your feedback and insights help us improve the courses and make the
education even better.

Feel free to reach out to us if you
have any questions, opinions, or
just want to chat about a course,
lecturer, or examiner.
