# Femme++
Femme++ is a committee that
primarily focuses on women,
non-binary, and transgender
individuals. We believe that it is
important to have a space where
those who often find themselves
in the minority within computer
science can talk about things
they otherwise find difficult to
discuss, or to just connect with
like-minded individuals and have
fun.

We spend time together, go out
for a coffee, eat dinners and have
parties.
